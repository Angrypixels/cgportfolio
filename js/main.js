      "Parque Bicentenario in Cartagena de Indias required a comprehensive wayfinding and signage system to establish clear navigation in this new community space. I developed a geometric visual language that creates a distinctive identity for the park while providing intuitive orientation for visitors.\n\nThe system features a cohesive hexagonal iconography set representing different amenities and facilities throughout the park, including children's areas, rest zones, sports facilities, oasis areas, community spaces, and essential services. The map design balanced simplicity with accurate spatial representation, using the custom iconography system to mark key locations throughout the space. The isometric geometric patterns used as background elements provide visual continuity across different signage applications, creating a contemporary design language that defines the park's identity.\n\nThe wayfinding system successfully establishes intuitive visitor orientation and accessibility in this new public space, enhancing the park experience through thoughtful environmental graphics that serve both functional and aesthetic purposes.",

      "Buenavista needed a cohesive visual identity and signage system that would celebrate the town's cultural heritage while enhancing tourism experiences. I developed a comprehensive brand system rooted in the town's natural landscape, musical traditions, and coastal character.\n\nThe centerpiece of the identity is a typographic treatment for the town name that integrates stylized maps of the region rendered in vibrant blues, greens, and yellows representing the sea, land, and sun. This cartographic typography creates a distinctive visual signature that captures Buenavista's geographic and cultural essence. \n\nThis project successfully positions Buenavista as a distinctive destination with a clear visual identity that honors its cultural heritage while providing functional environmental graphics that enhance the visitor experience.",
